format (.ar! format, for input to WEKA), do take a look at it. The idea is to be able to predict the 9th value,
number-of-rings, given the other 8 values, using the existing dataset to learn how to predict.

First, download and install WEKA, and spend a small bit of time, going through the basics (it is all provided
in the WEKA site): https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ (https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/). Here
(_WEKA/slides.html) is another intro' to WEKA.

Bring up WEKA Explorer, read in the shells.ar! dataset (look under Preprocess). In the dialog that comes up,
you can click on various attributes (age, length...) to see the distribution of data for that attribute. Next, click
on Classify, to bring up the UI for choosing mining algorithms. Click Choose, then select classifiers-
>functions->LinearRegression. Execute with the default algorithm params (eg. cross-validation, 10 folds),
look at the result.

0 points (-1 if you don't submit this). What is the MAE (mean absolute error)?

3 points. What is the equation for num_rings? You need to provide an equation, in the form of
y=f(x_0,x_1,x_2...), using the output that WEKA provides. As you know, this is the result of the 'mining' - for a
new shell, we can predict num_rings, by measuring the other params and inputting them into our equation.

1 point. Re-open the dataset, and keep only these columns: length, diameter, whole_weight, num_rings. Do
the linear regression again. What is the equation now? The idea is that now, we would only need do just 3
measurements, to predict num_rings.

Next, download and install KNIME (https://www.knime.com/) ("nime"), and work through the quickstart
tutorial. KNIME is also UI-driven, like WEKA; additionally, it's also visual-dataflow-driven, which means we
can do data mining with it, by 'connecting the boxes' (where each box reads data or does mining or writes
data, etc).

Use KNIME to perform linear regression, just like you did with WEKA. You need these nodes: AARF Reader,
Linear Regression Learner. Create and connect the nodes, and execute.

2+1=3 points. What is the linear equation now? Compare this to WEKA's output - what parameters have
similar coe"cients (where they di!er by 0.5 atmost)?

1 point. Set up a 'Decision Tree Learner' predictor, where 'Age' is the predicted variable. Note - think "simple"
- no need to partition the data into training and test data, etc! Provide a snapshot (.jpg or .png) of the entire
decision tree [OK if the nodes are too zoomed out and are therefore unreadable] - hint: look at the right
side of the split-pane window.
